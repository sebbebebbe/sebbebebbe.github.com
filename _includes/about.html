          I am a experienced developer with more than 10 years in the IT
          industry. <br />
          <br />
          During this time I have worked with software development and
          architecture especially within .NET. I have a broad expertise in both
          “front end” and “back end” development. I like working in teams but I
          am also used to work alone, preferably close to the customer in an
          Agile way. <br />
          <br />
          It is not just during work hours that I spend time with software, I
          always some kind of project running at home as well.
